            <p class="text-center"><i>"The team have successfully produced a Proof Of Concept system for a project involving MegaNexus and a partner organisation.

They were able to successfully create a working demonstration unit for a Case Management System that can connect to a third party application allowing 2 way Audio Visual communication to occur. They have delivered this system from design,  development and demonstration of system in a user scenario.

<br>From the feedback that has been received from MegaNexus management and their counterparts from our partner organisation the system has performed to expectations, and has been able to show how the integration of two products can achieve the required goals within the target industry."

                            to the front-end and some new screens to show the appointment booking process. We then agreed
                            to catch up again the following week for a further update.</td>

                            tasks left which include the backend/database, video conferencing integration, GP demo site front-end
                            and VISION API integration. We were told that the we would be getting the VISION API in at most
                            2 weeks. Bogdan also updated everyone on his research into video conferencing API’s, concluding
                            that the most viable option right now may be integrating skype into the demo websites as that
                            does not cost anything. We then organised to have skype progress updates twice a week.</td>

                            the client a document comparing the various API’s we found. Our next progress update is on the

                            into the server code for the care home site and then test the demonstration setup in preparation

                            for them, as well as for the GP site - viewing/booking appointments. We also demonstrated the
                            working 2-way video/audio consultation to the client. The client along with several other members
                            from the company thought the websites looked good and clean and they went through adding a new
                            patient to the care home website. We encountered some technical difficulties during the middle
                            of the demo but in the end the demo worked. We ended the meeting by asking for feedback from
                            the client, and we organised a set of action points for the following week.</td>

                            main features, receiving feedback on the sites throughout the demo. 352 were very happy with
                            the progress, noting that even though parts were left blank or unfinished, it was good as when
                            they go out to demo the system to potential clients it leaves the product open for improvements
                            and additions. At the end of the Skype call our client said they would contact us to sort out
                            hosting the site locally on their own servers or possibly through a URL in order for both parties
                            to view and play around with each site on their own.</td>
