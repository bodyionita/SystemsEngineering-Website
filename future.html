        <h1> Future Plan </h1>
        <hr>

        <p> In our latest meetings with the client we have agreed to build two demonstration systems based on our mockups.
            The current plan is to build one website that allows Care Home Professionals the ability to log in, add patients,
            view patient records and have a video consultation with a GP. The other website will be for GP's and will allow 
            them to perform similar actions with additional scheduling and note-taking features. 
        </p>

        <p> The main difference between the two sites is the look and feel of each one. In order to make the site 
            as familiar to GP's as possible, the client wants it to have a look and feel similar to the system 
            they currently use - VISION. Similarly for Care Homes, they want it to look and feel like some of 
            their existing NEO systems.
        </p>

        <p> Furthermore, we are still in the process of gaining access to the VISION API in order to pull patient and 
            scheduling data. Therefore we will be utilising simulated data when displaying the front-end. This will 
            not affect the demonstration as the sites will still perform the same functions as if we had the API.
        </p>

        <p> In order to complete the tasks below we will be splitting the work between us. One of us will work on the 
            Care Home site and another on the GP site, working on getting the look and feel elements accurate and the 
            required functionality working. Then another one of us will be working on getting the Video Conferencing 
            API working and a shared database which will be used to pass data between the two sites as required. 
        </p>

        <p> Regarding the tools we will be using for this demo, we are still unsure which direction we will take. 
            It is likely we will be using Bootstrap for styling the front-end as we have lots of experience with the 
            framework. With the Video API, we are in the process of researching possible candidates.
        </p>
        <p> A full list of tasks for these demo sites is in the table below. </p>
