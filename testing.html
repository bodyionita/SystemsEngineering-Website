            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <p>Throughout the entire development cycle we have also been thinking about testing, be it testing of the code
            or testing its compatibility. This was done to ensure that our platforms meet the high standards required by
            our client, so along with each new feature implemented we have been creating the tests accordingly.
            <br>This page goes into the details of each testing strategy we have went through.</p>

            <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
            <p>To ensure that our software is complete and correct, we developed a collection of unit tests to verify the back-end
            and front-end of the system. Using the unit tests whenever we were adding a new feature, or changed anything in the code,
                we were making sure that no new addition would introduce bugs into the code.</p>
            <p>
                Our back-end is based on Python so we made use of the <i>unittest</i> integrated library. Also for the purpose
                of better isolating different parts of the code, the <b>MagicMock</b> class of the <b>mock</b> library was used.
                This library allowed us to mock the connection to the Video API and check the rendering of the webcam independently
                of the status of the API.</p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of how the testing works:
            </p>
            <li> Testing if the application is running successfully.</li>
            <pre><p>def test_flask_application_is_up_and_running(self):
    response = urllib2.urlopen(self.get_server_url())
    self.assertEqual(response.code, 200)</p></pre>
            <li> Testing if the GP site appointment page renders the calendar pick option correctly.</li>
            <pre><p>def test_rendering_gp_appointments(self):
    # sends HTTP GET request to the application
    # on the specified path
    rv = self.app.get('/2/appointments')

    # assert the response data
    self.assertEqual(result.data, "Calendar")</p></pre>
            <li> Testing if the home page after login and login errors show up correctly.</li>
            <pre><p>def test_login(self):
    rv = self.login('admin', 'default')
    assert b'Left blank' in rv.data

    rv = self.login('adminx', 'default')
    assert b'Invalid username' in rv.data

    rv = self.login('admin', 'defaultx')
    assert b'Invalid password' in rv.data</p></pre>
            <h3>Manual Testing</h3>
            <p>Most of the tests included in the section have been already transformed into script run tests. For each of
            the test cases we sent both valid and invalid input so as to assert the correct output. All the tests written bellow
            have passed. This is due to extensive testing and bug-fixing the code so as to none of the scenarios we thought of would
                fail.</p>

            <h3>Compatibility Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Since the system we have built is meant to be accessed from a variety of devices such as Laptops, Desktop Computers,
                Tablets (mainly widescreen ones) it was necessary to conduct a number of trials using different devices and also
                browsers which they use to access the platform.

            </p>
            <h4>Operating System compatibility</h4>
            <p>
                Being a web-based platform, our system does not have many restrictions regarding the Operating System as long
                as it is capable of running a browser. The limitation comes from the OpenTok API as it is not capable
                of the 2 way conference on Mobile devices with the following Operating Systems: iOS, Android, Amazon Fire OS, Kindle OS.
                The list might not limit to this, but this was the range of OS we could test the platform on and discover the API does not
                work.
            </p>
            <h4>Browser compatibility</h4>
            <p>
                All the manual testing we have done have been conducted on most of the popular browser's that exists now, and have successfully
                concluded that it works seamlessly across all of them ( Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer).
            </p>
            <h4>Screen resolution/ratio compatibility</h4>
            <p>
                A big concern when we are talking about a web based platform is the responsiveness of all its elements. This means
                that we had to build the websites such as regardless of the screen resolution it is accessed on, all the necessary
                data is displayed correctly, and all sections of the website can be accessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                We achieved this through abiding to the Bootstrap Framework's general good practices and making use of its grid system
                and arrangement of the html elements based on the screen resolution. We tested it using Google Chrome's built-in
                functionality of resizing the screen and also making it seem as being accessed from a tablet, specially designed for this
                purpose.
            </p>
            <h3>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h3>
            <p>
                Last but not least, user acceptance testing had an important role in ensuring our software meets the need of our client
                and the future potential users, by seeing if it can handle real-world scenarios. We presented our solution to our client
                twice and during those times, we had a number of different people trying to use the system and see if they have
                any difficulties in understanding and/or getting the expected result after a precise set of actions.
