            <h1>Testing Tools Research</h1>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">“A dynamic verification that a program provides expected behaviors on a finite set of test cases”, as IEEE defined
                it, Software Testing is a Software Engineering subdivision that assures that the product works as expected,
                without having bugs or crushing. The program is verified while running it, over some given tests, and a bigger
                number of different tests suggest that the program is more likely to be correct and stable. Automated testing
                is a way of simplifying the process, decreasing the effort of the developer, with a minimum set of scripts.
                Due to the high demand, researches put a lot of effort on finding new methods of automating the testing methods,
                inventing tools that can carry the process. The method is called “a test automation framework”, and many
                such methods have been implemented lately. Some of them are Selenium, Watir, Windmill, Ranorex, SoapUI and
                Sahi.
            </p>

            <h3>Aims:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">The main aim of Software testing is to make sure that a software product is working as expected before putting
                it into use. This is expected to be the last stage of the production cycle, the one before finishing the
                project. Some years ago, all the testing methods were conducted by developers, but now many automated testing
                methods have been invented. Many errors are now caught at the testing stage, as when you use the automation
                you are testing a larger amount of inputs. </p>

            <h3>Types of testing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">Software testing has 2 distinct methods of testing as defined by Jovanović Irena:</p>
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                <dt>Black-box testing</dt>
                <dd>testing software based on output requirements and without any knowledge of the internal structure or coding
                    in the program. In another words, a black box is any device whose workings are not understood by or accessible
                    to its user.</dd>
                <dt>White-box testing</dt>
                <dd>highly effective in detecting and resolving problems, because bugs can often be found before they cause trouble.
                    We can shortly define this method as testing software with the knowledge of the internal structure and
                    coding inside the program.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p class="text-justify">For our project, we will mainly use the black-box texting, because we don’t have much experience with the API
                and the expected connections with the servers provided by MegaNexus, but we will try to use white-box as
                much as possible when we can handle it, as it is more efficient.</p>

            <h3>Levels of testing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">For being able to apply testing to a broad-range of applications, software testing can be abstracted to different
                levels. This levels as they are usually divided in 4 levels, with a bottom-up approach, higher levels assuming
                successful and satisfactory completion of lower level tests:</p>
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                <dt>Unit testing</dt>
                <dd>narrow and well defined scope which tests a certain piece of the software, without any dependencies and interactions</dd>
                <dt>Integration testing</dt>
                <dd>test the correct inter-operation of multiple subsystems</dd>
                <dt>System testing</dt>
                <dd>proving that the system implementation does not meet the system requirements specification</dd>
                <dt>Acceptance testing</dt>
                <dd>showing that the end product does not meet the user requirement</dd>
            </dl>
            <hr>
            <h2>Available tools</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">For our Automated Web Testing, we have researched on different tools, but we are waiting on the API to choose
                the one that fits our project the most. The tools we have researched are</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3><small>Selenium</small></h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">A well-known automated web testing tool used for automating web browsers across different platforms.
                        It also has the support of some large browser vendors who made Selenium a native part of their browsers.
                        As most of the forums are proposing this testing tool, we are considering it as a primary option,
                        also because it is very well documented.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><small>Watir</small></h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">A set of Ruby libraries for automating web browsers, it allows writing tests very easily, and also supports
                        maintaining them in a simple way. It drives browsers in a human behaviour, clicking links/buttons
                        etc., and checks the results. It is a very good tool as it is the most appropriate to a real scenario,
                        simulating a real user.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><small>Windmill</small></h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">Used for automate testing and debugging web apps, it has a cross-browser test recorder, JavaScript integration
                        and an interactive shell that automates web browsers. We are also considering this option as we believe
                        that is will be easier to test the video conferencing API using JavaScript.</p>
                </li>
