            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main challenges we faced on this project was determining what our client needed and wanted. 
                As our client was intent on producing quite a new system, they were not sure themselves what was required
                and so there was a lot of back and forth during development of the mock ups and the demo sites in order
                to ensure that we were on track with producing what the client wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, many of our requirements were constantly evolving throughout terms 1 and 2. Due to the nature
                of the project it was not feasible to determine a fixed set of requirements prior to development therefore
                some of our initial requirements from term 1 ended up being incomplete due to changing of ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another big challenge we faced during development was regarding the VISION API. Throughout most of term 1 
                and all of term 2 our client attempted to purchase access to the VISION PMS which would allow us to pull 
                patient data and doctor scheduling information into our application. This formed part of many of our requirements.
                Due to many complications, we ended up developing a simple shared database between our two demo sites in order to 
                simulate what VISION would be able to provide us. We populated the database with mock patients and doctors so that
                we could still demonstrate the other key functionalities of the system.
            </p>

            <li>VISION API implementation is incomplete as we do not have access to the API.</li>
            <li>Patient information panel for GP's during consultation's is incomplete.</li>
            <li>Minor text and heading text inconsistencies need to be worked out with the client.</li>

            <h2>Critical Evaluation</h2>
            <h4>Architecture</h4>
            <p>
                As our system was designed to be a simple proof-of-concept intended just for demonstration purposes, we believe that our simple system architecture is adequate.
                Obviously, improvements could be made if additional features are required but the system works well in its current state. Furthermore, due to the time constraints
                we had during the year, it was probably best that we went with a simple database and Flask app as if we had picked a more complicated and heavy technology to develop 
                with, we may not have been able to finish the system in time.
            </p>
            <h4>UI/UX</h4>
            <p>
                The UI/UX for the GP site was intended to be near identical to an existing system on the market, this was to ensure that potential clients would be able to navigate the
                interface with more familiarity. In this regard, we believe that the interface we developed for the GP site matched other system very well. With the Care Home demo site,
                we developed several Balsamiq mockups which went through a rigorous cycle of evaluation with the client to ensure that it met their criteria. During development we aimed
                to mimic the mockup as closely as possible, with minor changes being made where suitable. On demonstrating the final system to our client they had a very positive impression
                of the final Care Home UI. Regarding UX, we believe that further testing could be made to find the optimal experience regarding booking appointments and conducting consultations.
            </p>
            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <p>
                The application we have built has been stable throughout development and testing. Furthermore we conducted several demonstrations to our client and in each case there were
                no stabilities issues that we encountered.
            </p>
            <h4>Stability / Efficiency</h4>
            <p>
                The application we have built has been stable throughout development and testing. Furthermore we conducted several demonstrations to our client and in each case there were
                no stabilities issues that we encountered. Regarding the efficiency of our system, as it is a web application this metric does not quite apply, however both site's pages load
                quickly and so there are no obvious inefficiencies present in the system.
            </p>
            <h4>Compatibility</h4>
            <p>
                Our application uses Flask to run and so is compatible with any machine that supports Python 2.7+. We developed on Windows and our client's demonstration laptops would be running
                windows so there should not be any compatibility issues with the system. Furthermore, we have handed over the codebase to the client so they may set up the web server on one of their
                in house servers, providing easier access to their employees who wish to demo the system to clients.
            </p>
            <h4>Maintainability</h4>
            <p>
                The application in its current state would be hard to manage for a new developer. Currently our entire backend is contained in a single .py file which is not ideal. However,
                the current system is not very large and so it would be easy to get a new developer up to speed with how the code works and we adhered to best practices where possible. If 
                we had more time we would refactor the code to make it more readable and structured to increase its maintainability.
            </p>
            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <h4>Project Management</h4>
            <p>
                Regarding the management of our project, we believe that we managed the project well. We organised bi-weekly Skype progress calls with our client during development and prior,
                during the mock-up development and requirement gathering phase we kept in constant contact with the client, attending meetings to discuss the project plan and to ensure that our 
                mockups were meeting their criteria.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                If we had another six months the project could be expanded in many ways. Firstly, this would allow our client more time to acquire the VISION API.
                This would then let us integrate the API into our system and remove our database. Furthermore, this would then give us a specification to base many of
                the fields and text in our system off of. For instance, our resident pages contain fields which were made to look authentic but are not representative 
                of the fields contained in a real medical database. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Further improvements could then be made to our consultation screen, we could add our patient information panel and improve the positioning of elements
                on that page. Work could also be done on our waiting room page to make it function better for residents about to have their appointments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The backend structure of the code could then also be refactored to increase its maintainability and ensure that fewer bugs are added when new features are
                implemented. We could write further unit tests to ensure the VISION API integration works and any other additional features that we add.
            </p>
